## Architecture

This project is structured following the principles of Clean Architecture, which divides the code into distinct layers: presentation, domain, and data. This separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

## Installation

Once you have generated your project, make sure to execute the following steps to complete the project setup:

1. Build local packages.
    1. ```cd packages/movies_api```
    2. ```flutter pub get```
    3. ```flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs```
    4. ```cd packages/app_storage```
    5. ```flutter pub get```
    6. ```flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs```
1. From a terminal, run the following commands:
    1. ```flutter pub get```
    2. ```dart run build_runner clean```
    2. ```flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs```
2. Add your API KEY: This project requires an api key to be used to fetch the movies. 
    1. Get an api key from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api.
    2. Pass your api key to the flutter run command as an environment variable as follows:
```sh
$ flutter run --target lib/main.dart --dart-define=API_TOKEN=<your-apikey>
```

3. Or if you run this from VSCode you can use the launch configurations already set, so you just need to create a new ```config.json``` file under the ```.vscode``` folder, and have a content like:
```{ "API_TOKEN": "your-api-key" }```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```
